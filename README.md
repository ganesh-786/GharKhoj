GharKhoj is a modern, secure, and scalable property-search/web-listings platform designed to make finding, listing, and managing real-estate properties effortless. It provides rich search and filter capabilities, authenticated user flows, agent dashboards, and integrations for maps and communications.

This README is a professional guide to get you started, explain architecture and development workflows, and outline how contributors can help build the project to production-grade standards.

Project overview
----------------
GharKhoj helps users discover rental and sale properties with high quality listings, multimedia support, location-aware search, and responsive UX. The project aims to be production-ready, extensible, and developer-friendly.

Key features
------------
- Fast property search with filters (location, price, type, bedrooms, amenities)
- Map integration (Google Maps / Mapbox)
- User authentication (sign up, sign in, social login)
- Role-based dashboards (buyer/seller/agent/admin)
- Listing management (create, edit, publish, archive)
- Favorites and messaging between users and agents
- Image & video uploads with optimization
- Notifications (email / in-app)
- Responsive, accessible UI and SEO-friendly server rendering (if using Next.js)
- Audit logs and analytics

Tech stack
----------
- Frontend: React / Next.js or Vue / Nuxt (choose one in repo)
- Backend: Node.js + Express / NestJS (REST or GraphQL)
- Database: PostgreSQL (recommended) or MongoDB
- Object storage: AWS S3 / DigitalOcean Spaces
- Cache & search: Redis and Elasticsearch (for advanced search)
- Auth: JWT / OAuth for social logins
- DevOps: Docker, GitHub Actions CI, and optional Kubernetes for production
- Testing: Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress (E2E)
- Linting & formatting: ESLint, Prettier, Husky pre-commit hooks

Architecture & data model
-------------------------
High-level components:
- Client (SPA / SSR) — UI components, client routing, forms, map integration
- API server — authentication, listing CRUD, search endpoints, file upload handling
- Database — normalized schema for users, properties, photos, messages, transactions
- Object storage — images / attachments
- Search engine — denormalized index for fast geo + text search (optional)
- Worker / queue — background jobs (image processing, emails)

Suggested core entities:
- User: id, name, email, role, profile
- Property: id, owner_id, title, description, price, location (lat/lon), status, amenities
- Photo: id, property_id, url, metadata
- Message: id, from_user, to_user, property_id, body, timestamps
- ActivityLog: id, actor_id, action, target, details, timestamp

Getting started (local development)
-----------------------------------
These commands assume a typical Node.js monorepo structure. Adjust for your repo layout.

1. Clone the repo
   git clone https://github.com/ganesh-786/GharKhoj.git
   cd GharKhoj

2. Install dependencies
   - For root monorepo:
     npm install
   - For frontend:
     cd client && npm install
   - For server:
     cd server && npm install

3. Create .env based on .env.example (see section below)

4. Run services locally
   - With Docker Compose (recommended): docker-compose up --build
   - Or individually:
     - Start database (Postgres) and Redis
     - Start server: cd server && npm run dev
     - Start frontend: cd client && npm run dev

Environment variables
---------------------
Create a .env file in both server and client (if needed). Example variables:

SERVER (.env)
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=4000
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/gharkhoj
JWT_SECRET=your-strong-secret
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket
S3_REGION=your-region
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=key
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=secret
MAPS_API_KEY=your-google-or-mapbox-key
ELASTICSEARCH_URL=http://localhost:9200
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

CLIENT (.env)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPS_KEY=your-maps-key

Running with Docker
-------------------
A docker-compose.yml can orchestrate:
- postgres
- redis
- elasticsearch (optional)
- server
- client

Basic commands:
- docker-compose build
- docker-compose up
- docker-compose down

Testing
-------
- Unit tests (backend): cd server && npm run test
- Unit tests (frontend): cd client && npm run test
- E2E tests: npm run cypress:open or npm run cypress:run
- Run linters: npm run lint
- Run formatters: npm run format

Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery
--------------------------------------------
- Use GitHub Actions for:
  - Lint, test, build checks on PRs
  - Docker image builds and pushes
  - CD to staging/production (via Kubernetes, Docker Compose on server, or a PaaS like Heroku/Vercel)
- Protect main branch, run required checks before merging

Deployment
----------
- Recommended: containerize server and client, deploy to cloud provider (AWS ECS/EKS, GCP Cloud Run, DigitalOcean App Platform) or serverless (Vercel for frontend, serverless functions for backend).
- Store secrets in a secure vault (AWS Secrets Manager, GitHub Secrets).
- Use managed DB and object storage (RDS / S3) for reliability.

API overview (example)
----------------------
GET /api/v1/properties
  - Query params: q, lat, lon, radius, minPrice, maxPrice, beds, baths, page, limit
POST /api/v1/properties
  - Auth required: create a new property listing
GET /api/v1/properties/:id
PUT /api/v1/properties/:id
DELETE /api/v1/properties/:id
POST /api/v1/auth/signup
POST /api/v1/auth/login
POST /api/v1/uploads
POST /api/v1/messages

For full API docs, document endpoints with OpenAPI (Swagger) or GraphQL schema in /docs.

Contributing
------------
We welcome contributions. To get started:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a descriptive branch: git checkout -b feat/add-search-index
3. Make small, focused commits with clear messages
4. Run tests and linters locally
5. Open a Pull Request against main, with:
   - Description of change
   - Screenshots or recordings if UI changed
   - Linked issues (if applicable)
   - Testing instructions for reviewers

Contributing checklist:
- [ ] Tests added / updated
- [ ] Lint passes
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Behavior verified locally

Issues & templates
- Use issue templates for bug reports and feature requests
- Use pull request templates for PR descriptions and checklists

Roadmap
-------
Planned improvements:
- Advanced search with elasticsearch and geo-prioritization
- Full-text indexing and suggestions/autocomplete
- Monetization features (premium listings, paid promotions)
- Internationalization and multi-currency support
- Mobile app (React Native / Flutter)
- Accessibility audit & improvements

Security
--------
- Do not commit secrets. Use .env and add .env to .gitignore.
- Report vulnerabilities via GitHub security advisories.
- Regularly update dependencies and run dependency scans (Dependabot).
- Use HTTPS for all production traffic and enforce secure cookies.

Thanks for checking out GharKhoj — a platform created to make property discovery delightful and efficient. If you want, I can also:
- generate an example docker-compose.yml
- scaffold a detailed OpenAPI spec
- create GitHub Action workflows for CI/CD
- add issue & pull request templates

Pick one and I’ll scaffold it into the repo next.
